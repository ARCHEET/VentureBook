## Features

- **User Authentication & Authorization**:  
  Secure user signup and login using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) along with password hashing through bcrypt.

- **RESTful API**:  
  A well-structured API built on Express to handle routes for authentication, user profiles, and other business logic.

- **Database Integration**:  
  Data persistence is managed with MongoDB using the Mongoose ODM.

- **Environment Configuration**:  
  Configuration settings (such as the MongoDB connection string, port, and secret keys) are managed using dotenv.

- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**:  
  Configured to safely interact with frontend applications.

- **Robust Error Handling**:  
  Standardized error responses and logging to aid in debugging and maintainability.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
- **Express** – Fast, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database for storing application data.
- **Mongoose** – ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** – For stateless authentication.
- **bcrypt** – Library to hash and secure user passwords.
- **dotenv** – To load environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **body-parser** – Middleware to parse incoming request bodies.
- **cors** – Middleware for enabling CORS with various options.
- **nodemon** – Development utility to automatically restart the server on file changes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or later is recommended)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **MongoDB** (either locally installed or using a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/archeet/venturebook.git
   cd venturebook
   ```

2. **Install Backend Dependencies**

   Navigate to the backend folder and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following variables:

```dotenv
PORT=3050
MONGO_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

- **PORT**: The port number on which the backend server will run.
- **MONGO_URL**: Your MongoDB connection string.
- **SECRET_KEY**: A secret key used for signing JSON Web Tokens.

## API Overview

VentureBook's API is designed as a RESTful service. Here is a brief summary of the key endpoints:

- **Authentication**
  - `POST /api/auth/register` – Register a new user.
  - `POST /api/auth/login` – Login an existing user and obtain a JWT.

- **User Management**
  - `GET /api/user/:id` – Retrieve user profile details.
  - `PUT /api/user/:id` – Update user profile data.
  - `DELETE /api/user/:id` – Delete a user account.

- **Additional Endpoints**
  - Explore additional routes for venture-related content, messages, or networking features as implemented in the project.

*Refer to the API documentation (or source code) for complete details on request/response structures.*

## Development

For local development, you can start the server in development mode which automatically restarts on file changes:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To start the server in production mode:

```bash
npm start
```
